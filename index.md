I am a second-year PhD student at the  [Center for Computational Biology (CBIO)](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr), which is a joint research unit involving [Mines ParisPSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/), [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr/) and [INSERM](https://www.inserm.fr/).

My thesis is co-supervised by a multidisciplinary team of bioinformaticians: [Véronique Stoven](https://institut-curie.org/personne/veronique-stoven) and [Chloé Azencott](https://cazencott.info/) (CBIO-Mines Paris PSL/U900), a statistician: [Olivier Collier](https://sites.google.com/view/olivier-collier) (ModalX - Paris Nanterre University) and a biologist: [Clara Nahmias](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/clara-nahmias-a78b6468) ([Gustave Roussy Institute](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/)). 
My thesis is funded by by the Île-de-France Region as part of the [DIM AI4IDF](https://ai4idf.fr/).

My research project is on the "Development of machine learning approaches for the identification of a molecular signature for ATIP3-deficient triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), and new therapeutic targets and drugs".
