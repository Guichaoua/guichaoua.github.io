I am a second-year PhD student at Mines ParisPSL and Institut Curie.

My thesis is co-supervised by a multidisciplinary team of bioinformaticians: Chloé Azencott and Véronique Stoven (CBIO-Mines Paris PSL/U900), a statistician Olivier Collier (ModalX - Paris Nanterre University) and a biologist: Clara Nahmias (Gustave Roussy Institute).

My research project is on the "Development of machine learning approaches for the identification of a molecular signature for ATIP3-deficient triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), and new therapeutic targets and drugs".
